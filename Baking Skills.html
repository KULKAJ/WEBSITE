<h3>STEPS:</h3>
<p> 1. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug. 
    Mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with a good pinch of salt in a bowl. 
    Squeeze any lumps of sugar through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the carrots, raisins and half the nuts, if using. 
    Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins.</p>
<p> 2. Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. 
    Leave to cool in the tins.</p>
<p> 3. To make the icing, beat the butter and sugar together until smooth. Add half the soft cheese and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). 
    Remove the cakes from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing. Top with the remaining icing and scatter with the remaining walnuts. Will keep in the fridge for up to five days.
    Best eaten at room temperature.</p>

    <h3>STEPS:</h3>
    <p>1. Heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Grease and line a 20cm brownie or square tin. Put the flour, sugar and butter in a food processor and pulse until it forms a dough.
        Press the dough into the base of the tin, and press into the corners with your fingertips. Prick with a fork and bake for 20 minutes until golden and dry. Leave to cool.
    </p>
    <p>2. Put the caramel ingredients in a small pan over a medium low heat and cook, continually whisking for 2-3 minutes until the sugar has melted. Cook whisking for a further 6 minutes until thickened.
        Pour over the cooled shortbread, smooth over, cool to room temperature, and chill until set (about 2 hours). You can freeze to speed this up if you like.
    </p>
    <p>3. Melt the chocolate in the microwave or in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water until smooth and glossy. Leave to cool slightly, then pour over the set caramel.
        Cool again until set. Sprinkle with a pinch more salt and cut into squares with a hot knife to easily go through the chocolate. Best stored in fridge for up to 3 days.
